# Fluid_Simulation_KL25z
This project implements a real-time particle simulation on an 8x8 LED matrix using the NXP KL25Z microcontroller. The particles respond to simulated gravity, which can be dynamically controlled using a joystick. Joystick button toggles between three different simulation speed setting.  Capacitive slide on KL25z is used for resetting the particle position.
